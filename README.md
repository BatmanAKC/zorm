## Usage

Using Zorm is straightforward. Hereâ€™s a quick example to illustrate how to connect to a database and perform basic operations.

### Connecting to a Database

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const zorm = @import("zorm");

pub fn main() !void {
    const db = try zorm.connect("postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/mydb");
    defer db.close();

    // Your database operations here
}
```

### Creating a Table

```zig
try db.createTable("users", .{
    .name = "VARCHAR(100)",
    .email = "VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE",
});
```

### Inserting Data

```zig
try db.insert("users", .{
    .name = "John Doe",
    .email = "john@example.com",
});
```

### Querying Data

```zig
const users = try db.query("SELECT * FROM users");
for (users) |user| {
    std.debug.print("User: {}\n", .{user.name});
}
```

## Supported Databases

Zorm supports a variety of databases to suit your needs:

- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source object-relational database.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight database ideal for smaller applications.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for flexible data storage.

Each database has its own configuration requirements. Refer to the documentation for specifics on setting up each type.

## Custom Schema Support

Zormâ€™s custom schema support allows you to define your database structure according to your applicationâ€™s needs. This flexibility means you can easily adapt to changes in your data model without extensive rewrites.

### Defining a Custom Schema

You can define a custom schema by creating a configuration file. Hereâ€™s an example:

```zig
const schema = .{
    .users = .{
        .name = "VARCHAR(100)",
        .email = "VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE",
    },
    .posts = .{
        .title = "VARCHAR(255)",
        .content = "TEXT",
        .user_id = "INTEGER",
    },
};
```

This schema can then be used to create tables and enforce relationships between them.
